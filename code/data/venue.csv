"Here�s a list of all the venues we play in.  If you wish to play a club match outwith these locations, please call Gary on his home number at 0151 496 0777 to check that it�s okay.  I know this seems silly, but health and safety is really important and he needs to check that the facilities are safe.  Don�t forget what happened to Alexander that one time.",
